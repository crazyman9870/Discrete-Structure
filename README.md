# Discrete-Structure
In this class we were creating some sort of realtional database.
Each project is build ontop of the previous one.
As the project number increases another component is added to the overall program.
For example project 1 scans the text and creates tokens.
This next one uses those tokens to create objects.
Etc.

Project 5 is the final product of the parsing and storing of text into the database.
The Relational Database creates records, and then is programmed to read a set of rules to create more records in the database, based of the current information it holds.
Queries are then made on the database and the correct records are retuned.

One thing to note is this is one of my earlier projects, and being such, I explored several different coding styles thoughout the entirety of the program.
For example, project 1 uses both .h and .cpp files for each class. Project 3 only used .h files for the new classes added at that stage and so on.
The coding style is inconsistant, but I was trying to explore different techniques.
